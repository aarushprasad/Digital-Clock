# Digital-Clock
Prints a digital clock (formatted for a console of 42 lines long and sufficiently wide) with many frames (approx. 26 per second). There are two classes-- one is Clock, and the other is LargePrint. Clock calls the printing method of LargePrint to print the time every second, and LargePrint's printTime method prints the time given the hour, minute, and second.
